# FAQ

## Why/how did you start building RealGolf.games?

(Answered by Julian Hammer)

I enjoy playing golf, and my trainer introduced some games during lessons. I wanted to play them elsewhere, so I decided to write them in JavaScript code as a website. After a year, I rewrote the entire program in SvelteKit. I added user authentication with MongoDB to enable further progress and incorporated features like saving games to play later or having public profiles, which I am currently working on. Additionally, I introduced new games such as Precision and Sinking Ships, with more to follow in the future.
