## Introduction

The games represent different games you can play, including 4Winning, Exact, and Precision. You can access them by logging into your account and then open the Menu by clicking on the three bars labeled Menu in the top right corner or by pressing "ctrl+m".

## 4Winning

### About 4Winning

4Winning is a straightforward game with the goal of aligning four shots either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. It follows the concept of a basic Four in a Row game, but with a larger board than the traditional version.

### How to Play?

To play 4Winning you need a Distance Measuring device (e.g. Trackman) to measure the right distance you played and click the Field with the Distance written on it, for Example if you play 55 meters/yards you need to click the Field with 55 written on it, if you for example play 56 meters/yards and there is only a Field displaying 55-57 you still need to click the Field 55-57, because that is the Field which includes the numbers 55, 56 and 57.

Additionally, you can enter the distance into a text field above the game board with the description: "You can also enter the distance you have played here." This might be useful if you are playing on a small device, where the fields are small, or the device is shaking, and you wouldn't hit the correct field by clicking on them.

### What You Need?

To play 4Winning, you will need a set of clubs or at least one golf club, as well as a distance measuring device to measure the distance you have hit the ball.

## Exact

### About Exact

Exact is a game which goal it is to get as many points as possible in a limited number of shots (normally that are 20 shots per team).

#### Distribution of points

- Every multiple of ten (e.g., 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90) scores 3 points.
- All repeating digits (e.g., 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99) score 2 points.
- 100 scores 5 points.
- Anything above 100 or below 5 scores -1 point, and everything else scores 1 point if hit.

### What You Need?

To play Exact, you will need a set of clubs or at least one golf club, as well as a distance measuring device to measure the distance you have hit the ball.

## Precision

### About Precision

Precision is a accuracy-focused game where the goal is to play as close to a given distance as possible. Each player starts with 100 HP (Health Points), and the player with the most remaining HP at the end wins.

### How to Play

To play Precision, you need a Distance Measuring device (e.g., Trackman) to measure the correct distance you've played. Once you have the distance, enter it into the field with the placeholder "Please enter the distance you have played as a number." This means you only need to enter the distance without the unit. For example, if you played 150 meters/yards, enter "150" into the text field.

The yellow number represents the target distance you need to play, which by default varies between 0 and 150 meters/yards. You can change this by increasing the number in the text field below the "Choose Range" label.

### What You Need?

To play Precision, you will need a set of clubs or at least one golf club, as well as a distance measuring device to measure the distance you have hit the ball.
