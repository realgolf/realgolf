Dear members of the Real Golf Games community,

We are excited to announce a new feature on our website that allows users to specify their pronoun preferences. This addition marks another step in our ongoing efforts to create an inclusive and respectful environment for all members of our community. In this blog post, we want to delve into why we implemented this functionality and how you can use it to adjust your pronoun preferences.

## Why Pronoun Preferences Matter

Pronouns are an integral part of a person's identity, reflecting how they wish to be addressed in conversations and interactions. By giving users the option to specify their pronoun preferences, we demonstrate respect for their identity and create an environment where they can express themselves authentically. This is particularly important in our diverse community, where individuals of varying gender identities are represented.

## Promoting Inclusivity and Respect

The integration of pronoun preferences on Real Golf Games underscores our commitment to inclusivity and respect. By offering this feature, we aim to ensure that all members of our community feel welcome and valued. Our goal is to foster an environment where everyone can reach their full potential, regardless of gender, gender identity, or expression.

## How to Adjust Your Pronoun Preferences

Adjusting your pronoun preferences on Real Golf Games is simple. Log in to your account and navigate to your public profile. There, you'll find the "Edit Profile" button, which allows you to modify your settings. Select the "Pronouns" option and choose from the following predefined options:

1. Don't specify
2. he/him
3. she/her
4. they/them
5. Custom

If you choose "Custom," you'll have the opportunity to enter your own pronouns. Your selected pronouns will then be displayed on your profile, signaling to other community members how they can respectfully address you.

## Working Together for an Inclusive Future

At Real Golf Games, we firmly believe that diversity is our strength. By integrating pronoun preferences, we are taking a stand for inclusivity and encouraging others to follow suit. We invite you to embrace this new feature and actively contribute to building a community characterized by respect, tolerance, and belonging.

Thank you for your support and commitment to an inclusive future at Real Golf Games.

Warm regards,

Julian Hammer  
Founder, Real Golf Games Team
