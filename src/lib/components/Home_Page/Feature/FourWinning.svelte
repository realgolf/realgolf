<div class="feature">
	<h3>4 Winning</h3>
	<p>
		4 Winning is like four in a row, with some modification, the first modifaction is, that the game
		board has more columns and rows then a normal four in row, a normal four in row has a game board
		of 4x4, my version of four in a row has 8 columns and 9 rows, including the columns at the full
		right and full left, which just show the lateral deviation you are allowed to play in one of the
		diffrent modes you can play the game in.
