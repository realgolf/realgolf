	<h3>4 Winning</h3>
	<p>
		In 4Winning, the objective is to strategically connect four pieces in a row. Our version of the
		game features a larger board than the standard 4x4 layout, with 8 columns and 9 rows. The
		additional columns on each side introduce a challenge: players must hit a specific distance
		within the lateral deviation. This aspect becomes more pronounced in Silver Mode and above,
		adding complexity and requiring players to carefully consider their moves.
