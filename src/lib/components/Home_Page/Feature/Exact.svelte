	<h3>Exact</h3>
	<p>
		Exact is a game where the objective is to hit 100 or below while scoring the most points.
		Players earn points based on the following criteria: Achieving exactly 100 meters awards 5
		points, hitting multiples of ten earns 3 points, numbers with repeating digits score 2 points.
		Additionally, hitting the same row doubles the points earned. However, any other number
		exceeding 100 or falling below 5 results in a deduction of 1 point. Every other number between 5
		and 100 scores 1 point. The challenge lies in balancing accuracy with maximizing points to
		achieve the highest score.
