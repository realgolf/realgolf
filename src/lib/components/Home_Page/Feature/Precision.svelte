	<h3>Precision</h3>
	<p>
		Precision is a game where the objective is to get as close to the targets as possible. For every
		meter you miss the target, you will receive a deduction of one point. The winner of the game is
		the player with the highest points at the end. The game concludes until only one player has
		points remaining. You can observe the distance you need to shoot and the current team, along
		with the remaining points for each team.
