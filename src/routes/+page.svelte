			<h2>4 Winning</h2>
			<p>
				4 Winning is like four in a row, with some modification, the first modifaction is, that the
				game board has more columns and rows then a normal four in row, a normal four in row has a
				game board of 4x4, my version of four in a row has 8 columns and 9 rows, including the
				columns at the full right and full left, which just show the lateral deviation you are
				allowed to play in one of the diffrent modes you can play the game in.

			<h2>Exact</h2>
			<p>
				Exact is a game which goal it is to play exact as possible to a few numbers, for example
				every tens give 3 points and all numbers with twice the same number are giving 3 Points, 100
				meters gives 5 points, everything above 100 and below 5 gives -1 Points.
			</p>

			<h2>Precision</h2>
			<p>
				Precision is the third game I have developed. The objective of the game is to get as close
				to the targets as possible. For every meter you miss the target, you will receive a
				deduction of one point. The winner of the game is the player with the highest points at the
				end. The game concludes when only one player has points remaining. You can observe the
				distance you need to shoot and the current team, along with the remaining points for each
				team.
