    The aim of this golf game "Precision" is to retain as many points as
    possible out of the initial 100 points by executing precise shots. For each
    shot, the deviation of the ball from the target distance is measured.
    <br />
    <br />
    Precision is measured by the deviation in {measurement_unit} from the target
    distance. The closer the ball is to the specified distance, the fewer points
    will be deducted. It follows a deduction of 1 point per {removeLastLetter(
      measurement_unit
    )} deviation from the target.
    <br />
    <br />
    At the end of the game, the player who has retained the highest score out of
    the initial 100 points is declared the winner. This means that the individual
    with the highest score due to deductions emerges as the victor! Fairness and
    respect towards other players are paramount. Be sure to adhere to the rules and
    etiquette of the game, as well as the guidelines of the club.
