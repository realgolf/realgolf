	"4Winning_description": "In 4Winning, the objective is to strategically connect four pieces in a row. Our version of the game features a larger board than the standard 4x4 layout, with 8 columns and 9 rows. The additional columns on each side introduce a challenge: players must hit a specific distance within the lateral deviation. This aspect becomes more pronounced in Silver Mode and above, adding complexity and requiring players to carefully consider their moves.",

	"Exact_description": "Exact is a game where the objective is to hit 100 or below while scoring the most points. Players earn points based on the following criteria: Achieving exactly 100 meters awards 5 points, hitting multiples of ten earns 3 points, numbers with repeating digits score 2 points. Additionally, hitting the same row doubles the points earned. However, any other number exceeding 100 or falling below 5 results in a deduction of 1 point. Every other number between 5 and 100 scores 1 point. The challenge lies in balancing accuracy with maximizing points to achieve the highest score.",

The closer the ball is to the specified distance, the fewer points will be deducted. It follows a deduction of 1 point per {measurement_unit_without_last_symbol} deviation from the target. <br /> <br /> At the end of the game, the player who has retained the highest score out of the initial 100 points is declared the winner. This means that the individual with the highest score due to deductions emerges as the victor! Fairness and respect towards other players are paramount. Be sure to adhere to the rules and etiquette of the game, as well as the guidelines of the club. <br /> <br /> You can make the game more interesting by introducing additional challenges, such as playing in different weather conditions or on various terrains. Whether you are a novice or an experienced golfer, \"Precision\" offers an exciting opportunity to demonstrate your skills and precision. Enjoy the game and the company of your fellow players! <br /> <br /> Are you ready to perfect your golf swings and retain as many points as possible?
