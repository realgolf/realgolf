### Introduction

The modi's represent different games you can play, including 4Winning, Exact, and Precision. You can access them by logging into your account and then navigating to the 'Modis' tab in the dashboard or through the menu on the right-hand side.

### 4Winning

#### About 4Winning

4Winning is a straightforward game with the goal of aligning four shots either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. It follows the concept of a basic Four in a Row game, but with a larger board than the traditional version.

#### How to Play?

To play 4Winning you need a Distance Measuring device (e.g. Trackman) to measure the right distance you played and click the Field with the Distance written on it, for Example if you play 55 meters/yards you need to click the Field with 55 written on it, if you for example play 56 meters/yards and there is only a Field displaying 55-57 you still need to click the Field 55-57, because that is the Field which includes the numbers 55, 56 and 57.

Additionally, you can enter the distance into a text field above the game board with the description: "You can also enter the distance you have played here." This might be useful if you are playing on a small device, where the fields are small, or the device is shaking, and you wouldn't hit the correct field by clicking on them.

#### What You Need

To play 4Winning, you will need a set of clubs or at least one golf club, as well as a distance measuring device to measure the distance you have hit the ball.
